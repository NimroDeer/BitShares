     *  The block difficulty is calculated as the sum of all difficulties of

     *  When a name_trx is found, the name earns one repute point, when
     *  a name block is found, the name that found it earns an additional repute point 
     *  for each included transaction.

     *    1) register a public key to their name
     *    2) gain repute_points
